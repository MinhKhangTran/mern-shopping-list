<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Live Demo](https://shopping-list-mern.netlify.app)

Simple mern app to list shopping items with auth, roles and permissions and crud functions
Logged in user is per default an user and can only add and update/delete his own shopping item. The admin can update and delete every items. 
The backend used technologies like node, express, mongoose and some validation, async-handler and access control.
